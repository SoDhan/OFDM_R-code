On the Basis of an IEEE Paper on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multipexing which is cited below:
M. Huang, X. Chen, L. Xiao, S. Zhou and J. Wang, "Kalman-filter-based channel estimation for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems in time-varying channels," in IET Communications, vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 795-801, August 2007.

Now,the main aim is to use this as a basepaper and write down r code for this and then later we must use some data analytic tool instead of kalman filter for the unconstarined minimization problem addressed in the above paper
